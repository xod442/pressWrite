Add a post to a wordpressblog

Read the instant wordpress info. 
You need to be on a docker machine for this to work

pip install -r requirements.txt

change script it match username and password 

The way I envision is web based log file for an application. 

If you have an app in flask, you could build a db with some 
front end to track the logfile changes. 

OR

Spin up a quick wordpress server in docker and use it. 

Talk about being lazy!

That way you can have a gui for your app's logfile. No need to 
tail textfiles.

You'll thank me later..
